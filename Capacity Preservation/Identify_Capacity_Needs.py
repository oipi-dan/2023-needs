# # Need Category: Capacity Preservation #
# 
# **Measure**: VDOT Arterial Preservation Network or the state-maintained portion of the National Highway System in Virginia and including some additional highways that facilitate connectivity.
# 
# **What it means**: This VTrans Need Category focuses on the need for proactive measures to strike a balance between access and mobility.
# 
# **Applicable VTrans Travel Markets**: CoSS, RN
# 
# **Data Sources**:
# 1. VDOT, TMPD - Arterial Preservation Network
# 
# **Year of analysis**: 2023

# %% [markdown]
# ### Calculations ###
# 1. Identify roadway segments included in VDOT's Arterial Preservation Network
# 2. **Threshold for Need for Capacity Preservation**: Roadway segments within RNs or along CoSS and included in VDOT's Arterial Preservation Network are identified as those with a VTrans Mid-term Need for Capacity Preservation.
